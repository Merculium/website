            <h3>Behind the Lab Coat</h3>
            <p>Beyond my work in R&D, I navigate the world through an interdisciplinary lens shaped by mycelial intelligence, permaculture, Jungian psychology and Buddhist philosophy. I’m fascinated by the hidden patterns that shape our lives — from alchemical processes and mathematical fractals to sacred geometry and circular design. My curiosity pulls me toward ethnobotanics, herbalism, ecofeminism and earthen architecture, all of which feed into how I think about systems, sustainability and care.</p>
            <p>I work with analogue photography, colour theory and audiovisual storytelling — approaching design as both a sensory and symbolic language. I see creativity as a deeply multisensory experience, blending structure and intuition, science and soul. Working with me means collaborating in a space of depth, pattern recognition and the technologies of sustainable growth, renewal and persistence.</p>
